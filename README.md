MultiBoost
==========
Welcome to MultiBoost project!
----------
The MultiBoost package is a *multi-class / multi-label / multi-task classification* boosting software implemented in C++. It implements essentially a multi-class version of **AdaBoost** (namely **AdaBoost.MH**) along with several multi-class weak-learning algorithms and cascades. It is free and easy to build into other applications due to its high modularity.

If you use this software in any publication, please refer to the following article:
